# The Code remembers.
## Interpolation Searching
The Interpolation Search is an improvement over Binary Search for instances, where the values in a sorted array are uniformly distributed. 
Interpolation search may go to different locations according to the value of the key being searched.

Formula: positionFormula = startIndex + (finalIndex - startIndex) * (valueToFind - lowerValue) / (higherValue - lowerValue);

startIndex = 0;
finalIndex=values.Lenght-1;
lowerValue = values[0]
higherValue=values[values.Lenght-1]
valueToFind=???

I'll try to improve or break the codes as much as possible :)

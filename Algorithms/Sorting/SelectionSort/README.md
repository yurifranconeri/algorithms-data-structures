# Code is coming!
## Selection Sorting
The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning
Find the minimum values and store the current index and the minimum
Swap the values saving the minimum index value on temp variable and changing with the current index,  just check the code


- Selection Sort

I'll try to improve or break the codes as much as possible :)
